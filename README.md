# Old-hat Keyboards: Clicks Without Compromize

## Overview

The mechanical keyboard market is booming. Unfortunately, most popular keyboards are 75% or smaller, _especially_ in the custom category.

As screen reader users, we here at Old-Hat Keyboards understand how important keys like     `HOME`/`END`, `APPLICATIONS [context menu], and INSERT are for daily tasks. We've had countless conversations with our friends and colleagues in which we've heard some variant of, "I *need* a numpad!" This project aims to offer two lists.

* Full-size: keyboards with 104 or more keys.
* 80% (TKL): These keyboards have 87 keys. This is everything _except_ the numeric keypad..

Our end goal is to be the one-stop shop for those seeking a keyboard with zero compromises. If possible, we would like to blog/vlog about different steps on our respective keyboard journeys, as well. But please keep in mind that this is a passion project that we're working on in our spare time.
